# Artist Hangman
This is an educational game about female artists of the 20th and 21st centuries. Most of the featured artists are living and making are right now! 

This game is built with Bootstrap and jQuery. 

Though this was originally a homework assignment for coding bootcamp, I plan to keep expanding on it!
